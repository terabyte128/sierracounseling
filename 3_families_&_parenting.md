<h4>Families</h4>

If being a part of a family is one of the most natural of human experiences, why does it sometimes seem so hard to keep your family happy and healthy? Your children and spouse rely on you to create an environment in which they can flourish. I can help you build a family structure and household environment that improves the health and well being of everyone. 

<h4>Parenting</h4>

For over two decades I have been helping parents manage the minefields of parenting. Raising children challenges parents to examine their own upbringing as well as the expectations and assumptions parents bring to their roll. Your children's behaviors can strike an emotional chord that makes remaining a calm and objective parent difficult. I can help you re-establish a relationship with your children that provides them the positive structure they need to thrive and that is satisfying to you.
