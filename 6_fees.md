The fee for my psychotherapy service is $110 per 50-minute session. Payments by check, cash or PayPal are due at the time of service. I am currently an in-network provider for Regence/BlueShield, Value Options, Group Health PPO and First Choice. I am also licensed to accept most insurance policies as an out-of-network provider. Utilizing an out-of-network benefit requires you to seek reimbursement for payments you make to me for services. I will provide you with a letter, that you can forward to your insurance company, containing the information you will need to seek reimbursement. You will still be responsible for payment of my full fee at each session. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the psychotherapy benefits of your policy, including co-pays and deductibles, so being reimbursed for services will be a smooth process.
