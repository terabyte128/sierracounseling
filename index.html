			"Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans." We all experience life events that challenge our notion of what we expect our lives to look like and can struggle to move forward with confidence. Times of struggle and challenge can provide great opportunity for positive change if you are able to capitalize on the moment. My job as a therapist is to aid families and individuals identify the strengths and abilities they can bring to the challenging situations they face. Utilizing 25 years of experience working with families and individuals, I help clients clarify and break down the challenges they face and identify the resources they can utilize to make meaningful changes in their lives. I specialize in working with families experiencing challenging circumstances such as divorce, illness or acting out behavior. I can guide you towards a more satisfying and fulfilling family and personal life.
