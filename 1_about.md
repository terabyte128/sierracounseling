---

I have spent the past 25 years working with people to aid them improve the health and strength of their families. After working as a volunteer for Big Brothers and at a shelter for youth experiencing family conflict, I completed my Masters in Social Work at the University of Washington. As an MSW I have worked with youth in a residential setting and with children, youth, families and individuals in an outpatient mental health setting. For five years I served as Clinical Director and supervisor for Kent Youth and Family Services. In addition, I have worked as a court appointed Guardian Ad Litem and as an Ombudsman for the Washington State Office of Family and Children's Ombudsman. I bring all my experience and energy to help you build a more satisfying life.
