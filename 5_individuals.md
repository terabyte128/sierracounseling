There are times when working with me individually makes sense. Single parents often benefit from working through challenges in the privacy of individual sessions. All my work, however, is based on a systems perspective that is based on the principle that the people and institutions we interact with have a great impact on our lives and tend to shape our behaviors. Examining and modifying how we interact within our "system" can lead to more gratifying relationships, a greater sense of self-fulfillment and improved physical health. You can do it and I can help you find a more satisfying life!
